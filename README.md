# hacking_the_fender
Python console app designed to retrieve, manipulate, obscure and create data with CSV and other text files

## Description
This was a mini project completed as a part of earning the Learn Python 3 Codecademy certificate. The premise of this project was accessing the system of a hacker, who had gained illicit access to a list of passwords. Once in his system the file containing the hacked passwords needed to be modified to scramble the data. Finally, the signature of a different hacker was to be added to the changes to put the two at odds with each other.

I chose Python for this project because that is what I am currently studying in my bootcamp.
